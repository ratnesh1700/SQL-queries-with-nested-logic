query is used by the outer query for further processing.

Independent (Non-correlated) Nested Queries: These are executed first, completely independent of the outer query, and their result is then used by the outer query. They are typically written using operators such as IN, NOT IN, ALL, and ANY.

Correlated Nested Queries: Here, the inner query references columns from the outer query and runs once for each row processed by the outer query, making them potentially less efficient for large datasets.

Syntax and Examples
The general syntax for a nested SQL query is:

sql
SELECT column1, column2
FROM table1
WHERE column1 IN (
  SELECT column1
  FROM table2
  WHERE condition
);
